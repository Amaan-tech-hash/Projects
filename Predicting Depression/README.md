# Predicting Depression Among Students Using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict depression among students based on various factors such as academic pressure, sleep duration, dietary habits, and family history of mental illness. The goal is to leverage data-driven insights to assist educational institutions and mental health professionals in identifying students at risk and providing timely interventions.
